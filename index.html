              I love to try new things! Learning new and exciting things is a
              hobby of mine. I enjoy colaborating with others, because I see the
              value in having many eyes, and opinions included in a project. The
              outcome of any project that has had a good team behind it, always
              seems to be more appealing to others.

              I beleive there is a strong need for woman in coding, and I am
              inspired by code, and design, to create a more user friendly
              experiance with sites or apps that I will help develop in the
              future. I have ideas for apps that I feel would be valuable in
              this world. I have a creative mind who's gears are always turning,
              just waiting egerly for the next challange ahead.

          I am an artist deep down to my core. As I have said before, I truly
          love to try and learn new things, so I am a painter, sculpter, VJ, and
          DJ. I cant help myself I just love to create. I have realized while
          obtaining my Bachelors of Arts & Technology degree, that I can do
          anything I set my mind to, and that I am only truly happy when I am
          creating.
